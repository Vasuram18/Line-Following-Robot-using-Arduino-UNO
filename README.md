# Line Following Robot Using Arduino Uno

## Overview

This project involves the creation of a line-following robot using an Arduino Uno. The robot is designed to follow a black line on a white surface using infrared sensors. Additionally, it includes an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, which stops the robot if an object is detected within a certain distance.

## Features

- **Line Following**: The robot uses two infrared sensors to detect the black line and adjust its direction accordingly.
- **Obstacle Detection**: An ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to obstacles in front of the robot, stopping the robot if an obstacle is too close.
- **DC Motor Control**: The robot uses four DC motors controlled by the AFMotor library to drive and steer.
